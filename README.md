Django-heartbeat is a simple reusable app that checks and lists various information
about your project and its dependencies

# Requirements

* Python >=3.8 (tested with Python 3.8, 3.10)
* Django >=3.2<=4.2.6

# Installation

Install using pip:

```
pip install django-heartbeat
```

Next, add 'heartbeat' to your settings.py INSTALLED_APPS:

```
INSTALLED_APPS = (
  ...
  'heartbeat',
)
```

Configure urls.py

```Python
if 'heartbeat' in settings.INSTALLED_APPS:
    from heartbeat.urls import urlpatterns as heartbeat_urls

    urlpatterns += [
        url(r'^heartbeat/', include(heartbeat_urls))
    ]
```

# Usage

- `/heartbeat/`

  After this point you can access the /heartbeat/ endpoint and receive a 200 OK.


- `/heartbeat/1337/`

  If you want a more detailed view of some custom checkers you MUST configure a
  custom profile for heartbeat in your settings.py. The profile should be
  a dictionary containing at least the basic auth credentials or the key `disable`
  set to `True` to disable basic authentication.

e.g.:

  ```Python
HEARTBEAT = {
    'package_name': 'foo_project',
    'checkers': [
        'heartbeat.checkers.build',
        'heartbeat.checkers.distribution_list',
        'heartbeat.checkers.debug_mode',
    ],
    'auth': {
        'username': 'foo',
        'password': 'bar',
    },
}
  ```

If no checkers are defined, heartbeat will default to the following:

- `heartbeat.checkers.distribution_list`
- `heartbeat.checkers.debug_mode`
- `heartbeat.checkers.python`

# Available checkers

Please make sure you have the latest version of django-heartbeat since checker names changed in versions 1.0.8 and
2.0.0.
If for some reason you cannot install the latest version, read the release notes for the version you have and the
versions mentioned above.

`heartbeat.checkers.build`

- lists information about installed package
- Please be aware that in order for this checker to work you have to add the
  'package_name': 'foo_package' key, value pair in the HEARTBEAT settings

`heartbeat.checkers.databases`

- displays information about the connection with your configured databases

`heartbeat.checkers.debug_mode`

- displays whether the DEBUG mode is set to True or False

`heartbeat.checkers.distribution_list`

- lists all installed dependencies

`heartbeat.checkers.host`

- displays various information about your system
  (e.g. hostname, number of CPUs, uptime, used/free memory, etc.)

`heartbeat.checkers.memcached_status`

- displays stats about your Memcached.
- Before enabling this checker please make sure that you have installed the appropriate Memcached binding (the two most
  common are [python-memcached](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-memcached)
  and [pylibmc](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pylibmc))

`heartbeat.checkers.python`

- lists the current python version

`heartbeat.checkers.redis_status`

- checks your connection with the Redis server
- Make sure that you have CACHEOPS_REDIS configured properly in your settings.py

# Implementing your own checker

- my_checker.py:
  ```Python
  def check(request):
    """
    :param request: HttpRequest object
    :return: dict
    """

    # Checker logic goes here

    return {'ping': 'pong'}
  ```

Note: The function name of your checker MUST be 'check' and has to return a JSON-serializable object

- add it to the settings.HEARTBEAT config
  ```Python
  HEARTBEAT = {
      'checkers': [
          'heartbeat.checkers.distribution_list',
          'my_project.my_checker'
          ...

      ],
      ...
  }
  ```

Simple, huh?

If you would like to contribute to this library with a new checker (or any other
functionality), feel free to make a pull request.
